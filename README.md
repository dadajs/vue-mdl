## Overview
This project provides a starting point for building web apps from organized, highly [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability) components.

There are [many such starters](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8&q=react%20webpack%20starter&oq=react%20webpack%20starter&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i60j69i57j69i60l2.2247j1j7) for webpack and React. This project is for webpack and [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/).

Use this as a starter, or as inspiration for your own setup.

## Features
This is the default setup. Expand, swap, and otherwise customize as you see fit:

- VueJS:
    - [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)
- Webpack:
    - [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html)
    - Hot module reloading
    - Style injection
    - ES6 support via [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [PostCSS] plugins:
    - [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
    - [postcss-simple-vars](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-simple-vars) *or* [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties)
    - [postcss-calc](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-calc)
    - [postcss-custom-media](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-media)
    - [postcss-mixins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-mixins)
    - [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
    - [pixrem](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/node-pixrem)

## Quick start
```sh

# Clone this repo
$ git clone git@github.com:elcontraption/vue-webpack

# Install dependencies
$ cd vue-webpack
$ npm install

# Fire up webpack-dev-server
$ npm run dev

# Build to /dist
$ npm run build

``` 
Customize [webpack.config.js](webpack.config.js) as you need.

## Workflow

### Initial setup
By default, the app entry point is [`src/main.js`](src/main.js). Define routes in [`src/routes.js`](src/routes.js).

### Styles: global and modules
Configure global styles in [`src/styles/global`](src/styles/global) and import in the [main stylesheet](src/main.css).

Place reusable style modules in [`src/styles/modules`](src/styles/modules), and import them within your component stylesheets:

```css
/* /components/header/style.css */
@import 'colors';

.Header {
    background: $yellow;
}
```

### Organized components
Each component has its own directory within [`src/components`](src/components). A component's script, styles, and template are all namespaced and organized within the component's directory.

### Organized views
Views are organized similarly to components, isolating view-specific scripts, styles, and templates within their own directories in [`src/views`](src/views).
